Just weeks back, The Wire did a program critiquing the judiciary’s accountability system, calling it faulty, weak and toothless, while also suggesting measures to change the way judges are appointed. In another program, in February this year, The Wire had a panel discussion over whether the judges are overstepping in various capacities.",

It must be recalled that in the 2005 state assembly elections, the BJP was by far the largest party, winning 30 seats out of the 63 seats it contested. The BJP’s pre-poll alliance partner JD(U) contested the other 18 seats and won 6. This took the NDA tally to 36 in the 81-member Assembly. The UPA parties were far behind with JMM winning 17 and Congress winning just 9 for a total of 27 seats, if you would like to include the NCP’s lone MLA as well. Immediately after the results, the BJP received the support of 5 other MLAs: 2 from the AJSU (All Jharkhand Students Union), the lone MLA from the Jharkhand Party and 2 other independents. This took the NDA tally to 41, which would be a clear majority.",

Hamid Ansari, who has been accused of lobbying for dreaded gangster Mukhtar Ansari by dialling the police station despite being VP, has been accused of links to questionable people and organisations, including outfits under scrutiny for anti-India activities. He has been accused of prioritising Islamism over Indian interests. Back in 2022, top diplomat Deepak Vohra had alleged that Ansari betrayed India’s intelligence officers in Iran, and when their family members begged him to intervene to get them released, he declined to act. Earlier, a Pakistani journalist, Nusrat Mirza, had claimed that he was invited to a seminar on terrorism by then-Vice President Hamid Ansari and spied on India, although he later claimed that he met former PM Manmohan Singh.",

Firstly, the kind of criticism Dhankhar is subjected to comes across as an attempt to silence constitutional functionaries from engaging in fair discourse about institutional balance. The idea behind framing Dhankhar’s comments as an attack on the judiciary’s independence and reputation is to close doors for an open debate, essentially placing the apex court beyond reproach. While the leftists accuse Dhankhar of violating constitutional principles, it is they who are undermining the constitutional principles, which suggest that in a healthy democracy, no institution, including the judiciary, is immune to criticism. Also, proposing an amendment is NOT an insult to the judiciary or the Constitution.",

      "text": "Secondly, the leftist media’s ad hominem attacks on VP Dhankhar calling him a ‘partisan attack dog’, ‘stooge’ and ‘lapdog’ or accusing him of breaching constitutional principles, more than their outrage, is actually an attempt to deflect focus from why Dhankhar said what he said to who and against whom was the statement made. It is a typical liberal tactic of prioritising sensationalism over substance. The personal attacks on VP Dhankhar and his integrity amount to character assassination, not fact-based counterarguments. While the leftist media displayed concern for the impact of Dhankhar’s critical comments on public trust in the judiciary and disrespect of the constitution, they themselves resorted to trivialising the importance of a constitutional post. The liberal critique sets a dangerous precedent that stifles open debates and criticism, especially in matters involving institutional scrutiny, and normalises launching ad hominem attacks on even the Vice President of India over ideological differences.",

They went with the understanding that they might not return, embracing death as a natural transition rather than a tragedy, accident, fear or shock. This practice was not chaotic or reckless; it was done with dignity and acceptance, with younger companions from the village or neighbourhood guiding them. The losses, if any, were minimal because the journey was taken with restraint, preparation, and spiritual resolve, not as an impulsive, desperate act,” Jha writes.",
